This program is made using the restuarant order example provided, it allows users to add, view, complete, and save orders.

An ArrayList stores the active orders, and a seperate array stores completed orders. Recursion is used in the input validation to ensure users enter valid inegers. File persistence uses the text files to save and load data automatically. Exception handling prevents crashes from invalid inputs and file errors.
